'''
Make a program which will randomly create a characterâ€™s stats based on
several rules set by the user. Have it generate a class, gender,
strength/magic/dexterity points, and extra abilities or trades.
Have the program save it to a file which can then be printed out
so that it can be used in a game.
Extension: 
1. Make a mystical name generator.
   Perhaps randomise different name parts such as sha-ra-lam or big-lim-con
   to create names for each of your randomly generated characters.
