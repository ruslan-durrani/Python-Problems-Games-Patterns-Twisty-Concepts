'''
Ask the user for a number.
Depending on whether the number is even or odd,
print out an appropriate message to the user. Hint:
how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?

num = int(input("ENTER A NUMBER :.. "))
if num%2==0:
    print("Even")
else:
    print("ODD")
