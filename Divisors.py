'''
Create a program that asks the user for a number
and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number.
(If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides
evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26
because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

while i < num :
    if num%i==0:
        list1.append(i)
    i+=1
print("The list of divisors is :.. ", list1)
